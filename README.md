# Blockchain â€“ Course Summary

## Overview

This repository documents the work completed for the **Blockchain** course. The primary learning focus was on understanding how decentralized applications (DApps) work, how smart contracts are written in Solidity, and how blockchain logic is integrated and deployed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The hands-on learning was primarily done through the **CryptoZombies** interactive course.

## Learning Resources

The following online interactive courses were fully completed on [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en/course):

### 1. [Solidity: Beginner to Intermediate Smart Contracts](https://cryptozombies.io/en/course)
> This course introduced the fundamentals of Solidity and smart contracts, covering:
- Writing and deploying basic smart contracts
- Working with variables, functions, mappings, structs
- Inheritance, modifiers, and visibility
- Handling events and ownership logic
- Developing logic for a turn-based game using smart contracts

### 2. [Advanced Solidity: Get In-depth Knowledge](https://cryptozombies.io/en/course)
> This follow-up course expanded on real-world application development:
- Building and deploying Ethereum DApps
- Using the **Truffle** framework
- Testing contracts and managing migrations
- Using Web3.js for frontend interaction
- Implementing off-chain and on-chain logic securely
